# VR Wheelchair Simulator

## Overview
VR Wheelchair Simulator is a 3D virtual reality application developed in Unity that simulates wheelchair navigation in everyday environments. The project is designed to help users understand accessibility challenges and mobility barriers through a first-person immersive experience.

## Project Motivation
This project explores how 3D virtual reality can be used as an educational and empathy-building tool for accessibility and inclusive design. By placing users in the perspective of a wheelchair user, the simulation highlights physical obstacles and environmental design limitations that are often overlooked in public and private spaces.

## Technologies Used
- Unity
- C#
- Oculus / VR SDK
- 3D environment modeling
- Android (APK build)

## Features
- Realistic 3D wheelchair movement and control mechanics
- Navigation through interactive 3D environments
- Physics-based interactions within the VR space
